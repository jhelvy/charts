# charts

A repo of reproducible charts.

To reproduce any of these charts, follow these steps:

1. Fork or download all of the files in this repository.
2. If you haven't already, [install R](https://cloud.r-project.org/) and [install RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/) on your computer.
3. Open the "charts.Rproj" file, which will open RStudio and set the working directory to the local folder on your computer containing the files in this repository.
4. Open and run the "makePlots.R" file in any of the folders to produce the plots, which will be saved in the corresponding "plots" folder.

**Note**: Most of these plots require additional libraries - read the top of each "makePlots.R" file to see which ones you should install.
