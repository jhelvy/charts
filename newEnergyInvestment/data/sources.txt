The following images were analyzed to collect data:
- chinaBySector.png
- europeBySector.png
- usBySector.png
- worldBySector.png

Data for the following files were directly copied from the images:
- china_total.csv
- europe_total.csv
- us_total.csv
- world_wind.csv
- world_solar.csv
- world_other.csv

Data for the following files were not able to be directly copied from the
images. As a result, data were measured using
WebPlotDigitizer: https://automeris.io/WebPlotDigitizer/
- china_solar.csv
- china_solar_wind.csv
- europe_windon.csv
- europe_windon_windoff.csv
- europe_windon_windoff_solar.csv
- us_wind.csv
- us_wind_solar.csv
- world_total.csv

For the measured data:

The data in each file mark the point (in $USD Billion) of each bar
in each figure. For example, "china_solar.csv" marks the investment in China
in solar energy, while the "china_solar_wind.csv" marks the investment in China
in solar + wind energy. So to get the wind energy investment, you need to
subtract the values in "china_solar.csv" from "china_solar_wind.csv".

The first column in each data file are a series of "Bar" values, which mark
the year. Bar0 is 2005 and Bar13 is 2018.
